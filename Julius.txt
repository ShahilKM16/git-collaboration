I am Julius Such. I am graduating this Fall semester. I want to be better at Web development.
I only about rails but haven't really tried the other ones. I am interested in doing more than 
is expected in class.

I plan on making a mobile app that will further utilize BYUH facilities. In my mobile app, I am thinking 
about letting user find players with certain games on campus. A user might flag online that he is 
looking for somebody to play pingpong. The students who have the same app, will get a notification 
and they can accept that invitation.
