Hi! I'm Blake Peterson, I'm from North Carolina and I like to go hiking, swimming and surfing!
I'm looking forward to learning more from this class because I'm really interested in javascript and web design using javascript. 

For my final project, I think I want to make a text-based multiplayer game. It'll have fairly simple mechanics, but I think it'd be cool
to have turn based combat or something like that in a multiplayer game.
