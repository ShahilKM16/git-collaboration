I am Yuxian Gu and I am graduating this semester.

I am hoping to learn more about APIs as I am interested in software / mobile apps development. Since I took CS401 first, I hope I can implement the project I worked on (not the same idea) with more features, better UI and user experience.

My idea for the final project will be a community buy-and-sell bulletin board. It will be similar to the marketplace feature on Facebook, but to make it easier and give clearer guidelines, we will keep everything short and simple. Users can sign up and then post and comment, but only the admin can have full access to all the users.
